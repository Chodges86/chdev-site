          </p>
          <p style={{margin: 0}}>good planning</p>
          <p style={{margin: 0}}>a great design</p>
          <p style={{margin: 0, marginBottom: "20px"}}>and beautiful code!</p>
          <p>
            But the most important thing is good communication. During the
            process, we will be working together accomplish several tasks that
            come together and result in your website.

        </div>
        <img src={processGraphic} alt="" />
