        <p>I can create a website that suits your needs exactly.</p>
        <p>
          Whether you need a small site to show off your work and put people in
          touch with you, or a site that provides dynamic information and
          functionality to your users. Let me know what your vision is and I'll
          create it.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I specialize in creating affordable websites for small businesses and
          organizations as well as handling some of the other technical aspects
          that come with owning a business. This means you can focus on your
          business and organization needs and let me handle the website
          development, launch, and maintenance.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          As a freelance developer, I can offer these services for a fraction of
          the cost you would pay to hire an web developing organization.

          Iâ€™ll take care of the entire process from beginning to end, so you can
          focus on you. Part of that process is setting up hosting for your
          website so the world can have access to see your site.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>This includes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Finding you a domain name and the registration</li>
          <li>Setting up hosting for the website.</li>
          <li>
            Setting up SSL certificates so you can provide a secure site your
            users can trust
          </li>
          <li>Monthly maintenance checks and updates to the site</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p>
          Another part of the process is maintenance and updates. I can monitor
          your site monthy to make sure that it stays functioning properly. This
          also includes making updates to the libraries and packages that are
          running behind the scenes as well as content updates when you need it.
